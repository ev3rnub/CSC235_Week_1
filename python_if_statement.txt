**Python 3 “if” Cheat Sheet**

- **Purpose**
  The `if` statement directs program flow by executing a block of code only when a given condition evaluates to a truthy value. It can be followed by optional `elif` (else‑if) clauses and a final `else` clause that runs when none of the previous conditions are true.

- **Basic Syntax**
  ```python
  if condition:
      # indented block runs when condition is true
  elif another_condition:
      # runs only if the first condition was false and this one is true
  else:
      # runs when every preceding condition was false
  ```
  *Indentation* (typically 4 spaces) is mandatory; Python uses it to delimit the blocks.

- **Condition Rules**
  - Anything that can be interpreted as a Boolean (`True`/`False`) is allowed: comparisons (`a == b`), function calls that return a bool, or any object whose truth value is defined by its `__bool__`/`__len__` method.
  - Empty containers (`[]`, `{}`, `()`, `''`), numeric zero, `None`, and `False` are *falsy*. Everything else is *truthy*.

- **Logical Operators**
  - `and`: true if **both** operands are truthy; short‑circuits on the first falsy operand.
  - `or`: true if **any** operand is truthy; short‑circuits on the first truthy operand.
  - `not`: negates the truth value of its operand.
  Parentheses can be used to group expressions and make precedence explicit.

- **Chaining Comparisons**
  Python allows natural mathematical chaining:
  ```python
  if 0 < x <= 10:
      ...
  ```
  This is equivalent to `0 < x and x <= 10` but evaluates `x` only once.

- **Multiple Conditions on One Line**
  Use a single `if` with a compound Boolean expression, but keep readability in mind:
  ```python
  if (a > 0 and b < 0) or (c == 42):
      ...
  ```

- **One‑Liner (Ternary Conditional Expression)**
  For simple assignments or returns you can embed the conditional in an expression:
  ```python
  result = "yes" if flag else "no"
  ```
  This is *not* a statement; it cannot replace a full `if` block that contains multiple statements.

- **Inline `if` without `else`**
  Occasionally you just want to execute something when a condition holds and do nothing otherwise:
  ```python
  if debug: print("debug mode on")
  ```
  Remember that the colon and indentation (or a single statement on the same line) are still required.

- **Nested `if` Statements**
  Indentation naturally nests blocks:
  ```python
  if user_is_admin:
      if request.method == "POST":
          handle_admin_post()
      else:
          show_admin_dashboard()
  ```

- **`elif` vs. Multiple `if`s**
  - Use `elif` when the conditions are *mutually exclusive*; only the first true branch runs.
  - Separate `if` statements are evaluated independently, so more than one block may execute.

- **Common Pitfalls**
  - **Assignment vs. Comparison**: Python uses `=` for assignment and `==` for equality comparison; writing `if x = 5:` raises a syntax error.
  - **Using `is` for Equality**: `is` checks object identity, not value equality. Use `is` only for singletons (`None`, `True`, `False`) or when you intentionally need identity comparison.
  - **Mutable Default Conditions**: If a condition depends on a mutable default argument, remember that the default is evaluated once at function definition time.
  - **Forgotten Indentation**: Missing or mismatched indentation leads to `IndentationError` or logical bugs.

- **Truthiness Customization**
  You can define how your own objects behave in Boolean contexts by implementing `__bool__(self)` (returning `True` or `False`) or, for older code, `__len__(self)` (non‑zero length is truthy).

- **Quick Example**
  ```python
  def categorize(value):
      if value is None:
          return "missing"
      elif isinstance(value, (int, float)):
          if value < 0:
              return "negative"
          elif value == 0:
              return "zero"
          else:
              return "positive"
      elif isinstance(value, str) and value.strip():
          return "non‑empty string"
      else:
          return "other"
  ```

  This example shows:
  * `if … elif … else` hierarchy,
  * nesting of another `if` block,
  * use of `is` for the `None` singleton,
  * `isinstance` for type checking, and
  * a fallback `else` for everything not caught earlier.

That’s everything you need to write, read, and debug `if` statements in Python 3.
Keep the indentation clean, think in terms of truthy/falsy values, and use `elif`
when you want mutually exclusive branches. Happy branching!
